description: |-
  This Terraform module sets up a DNS infrastructure on AWS, including Route 53 resolver endpoints and custom resolver 
  rules. It supports both inbound and outbound resolver endpoints, integrates with AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) 
  for resource sharing, and allows for custom resolver rules and associations. The module is designed to be used in a 
  hub-and-spoke network topology, with configurable options for VPC, subnets, and security groups. It also includes 
  support for tagging and various protocols such as DoH and Do53.
